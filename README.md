# Bowling

This is the repository which is designed for the (TODO: update guide link) Studio 2 assignment.
You can use this as a reference to check the C# logic, or see how the scene elements and game objects are organized.

To set it up, you can [clone this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) and then open it with the Unity Hub by just opening the root folder of the project.
Unity should automatically recognize this is a valid Unity project, and since you should already have the right version installed you should be able to open it easily.
If you are unsure, or Unity Hub says the wrong version is installed, follow the [setup guide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UBCO-COSC-416/.github/main/profile/Assets/UnitySetupGuide.pdf)
